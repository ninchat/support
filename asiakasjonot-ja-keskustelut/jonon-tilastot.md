# Queue statistics

Go to queue statistics by clicking the arrow icon next to the queue name in the Sidebar and selecting "Queue statistics".  
\(This requires organization operator rights.\)

Statistics run almost in real time, updated within an hour or so. You can view chat history, tags, user satisfaction, survey responses, and metadata.

The information and chat history can be downloaded and saved as a CSV file or automatically exported to a customer's CRM system \(ask Ninchat staff for more details\).

To exit the queue statistics, click "Queue statistics" in the top of the view and select "Close".

The statistics page consists of:

* Selections
* Charts
* Specific statistics
* Daily statistics and chat history

![Example charts that represent statistics](../.gitbook/assets/stats3%20%283%29.png)

The charts give you a quick overview of events. You can view:

* Number of conversations.
* Number of accepted and dropped requests.
* Average times of conversation, queueing, and exit tolerance.
* Ratings and their amount.

A customer's arrival in the queue is called a request:

* Accepted request: Customer is picked from queue by an agent.
* Dropped request: Customer is not picked from queue.

## Customer service specific statistics
