# How to remove an agent from organization?

If an employee is retired or transferred to another position, he/she is likely to be removed from the organization, queues, and team channels on Ninchat.

## Remove an agent from the organization and queues

Managing agents of an organization requires organization operator level.

1. Click the name of the organization in the upper left corner and select "Organization settings" from the drop-down menu.
2. Find the agent name that you want to remove \(or use filter to search for it\), then click the name row.
3. In the edit view, click the "Remove membership" button.

The agent should now be removed from the organization and queues.

## Remove an agent from a channel

Removing an agent from a channel requires moderator rights of that channel. An agent must be removed from each channel separately, as the agent will not leave any channels automatically even though he/she is removed from the organization.

1. Make sure you have moderator rights of the channel. If you are a channel operator, you can grant the moderator rights to yourself by clicking your name in the channel member list and selecting "Give moderator rights".
2. Click the name of the agent to be removed and select "Remove from channel" in the drop-down menu. The user will be removed from that channel.
3. Repeat for other channels as needed.
