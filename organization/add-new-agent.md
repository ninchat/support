# Add a new agent

## Add a new agent

These are the main steps how a new agent can be invited to your organization and customer care queues:

1. The person is invited to a team channel.
2. After the person accepts the invitation, he/she can be added to the organization.
3. The agent is then given the rights to answer queues.

In the "Organization" tab, click the agent row in the member list to see the agent's details and his/her rights in a new view.

In the new view, you will see the list that shows all of your organization's queues. Check the box \(under "Member"\) of an appropriate queue\(s\) for that agent. Queue agent status can be granted according to knowledge or field e.g. language skills, information, job, location, etc.

You can give organization operator rights to an agent if you want he/she to view statistics and message history of \(all\) queues, and manage other users in the organization, by clicking the button "Give operator status".

You can also remove an agent from the organization and queues by clicking the button "Remove membership". Please note that the user must be removed separately from the team channel and other chat channels.

You can return to the user list by clicking the "Back" button.
