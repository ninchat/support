# Save chat history

You can save a group chat discussion to your own computer in CVS format which can be opened e.g. in Excel.

The CVS file displays nicknames of the chat participants. If the subjects are sensitive or identifiable by their nicknames, we recommend replacing the chat nicknames with Excel's Find and Replace function to make them completely anonymous, e.g. "Chat 1", "Chat 2", etc.

## Download a chat history

* Make sure you are on the group chat channel of your choice on Ninchat.
* Open the menu by clicking the channel name at the top left of the conversation section and select "Download message history".
* Set the start and end dates and times for the chat history you want to download.
* Click the cloud icon on blue background to save the chat history to your computer.
