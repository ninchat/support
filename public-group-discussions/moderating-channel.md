# Moderating a channel

## Overview

Group discussions can be controlled and moderated in the following places: Channel settings, Conversation tools, User menu (through the member list), and Channel menu.

Moderation tools appear when the agent has been granted moderator rights![](../.gitbook/assets/moderator.png)of that channel. Channel operators can give moderator rights to other agents.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you have been granted moderator rights, please refresh the page for the change to take effect.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Do not use moderator rights unnecessarily <a href="ala-pida-moderaattorioikeuksia-turhaan-kaytossa" id="ala-pida-moderaattorioikeuksia-turhaan-kaytossa"></a>

Moderator rights should not be held to no purpose, especially on private team channels. So that e.g. moderator will not accidentally hide messages or delete users from the channel.
{% endhint %}

## Moderation tools

![Moderation tools and options](<../.gitbook/assets/Channel embed moderation (2).png>)

### Hide messages

Moderation tools allow you to hide messages from conversations, such as aggressive or irrelevant messages. See instructions below. In order to see the hidden messages yourself, you need to make the hidden messages visible in your settings. Follow the guide: How to organize group dissusion? > Moderator user settings.

{% content-ref url="organize-group-discussion.md" %}
[organize-group-discussion.md](organize-group-discussion.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Channel settings

#### Who can write to the channel

The channel settings let you define how guests can write to the channel. For example, you can reduce inappropriate behaviors by automatically silencing new guests or automatically hiding messages from new guests.

For more information, see: How to edit channel seetings? > Who can write messages.

{% content-ref url="../team-channels/channel-settings.md" %}
[channel-settings.md](../team-channels/channel-settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

See more options under "Channel menu".

### Conversation tools

The tools for moderating comments during conversations appear when you hover over a comment.
