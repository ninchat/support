# Organization

## General info

An organization is a private and closed space in Ninchat for your company or community. Organizations include: 

* Members/agents
* Channels for group conversations
* Customer queues and conversations, statistics and settings
* Tags

Organization is managed by organization operators. They add and administer members and permit rights for customer queues, and their statistics and configurations.

Channels in organizations are mainly private, invite-only so only users how are invited, can join them. Channel operators can send channel invites to existing users and via email to new ones. You can create channels for different topics or departments: General, Coders, Sales,... - or for projects and invite your affiliates solely to those channels. 

More about adding and managing agents below.

## User levels and rights

| Level | Rights |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Queue member** | A queue member can see the customer queue and pick customers from the queue in which he/she is a member. He/she can also manually open and close the queue, but cannot see queue settings, queue statistics, message history, and organization settings. |
| **Organization operator** | An organization operator can access organization settings and add new agents to the organization. He/she can also edit tags and chat settings, see and edit queue settings and schedule, and access queue statistics and message history. |
| **Organization owner** ![](../.gitbook/assets/owner-key.png)  | An organzation owner is the agent who created the organization. He/she can add encryption keys to your organization for transmitting encrypted metadata. |
| **Channel operator** | A channel operator can control a team channel or public discussion channel. He/she can change the channel settings and invite new agents to the channel. |
| **Channel moderator** | A channel moderator can moderate discussions and posts on a team channel or public discussion channel, and remove users from that channel, but cannot edit the channel settings. |

## User settings in organization

You can access organization settings by clicking the name of the organization in the upper left corner and selecting "Organization settings". \(This requires organization operator level.\)

In the first tab \("Organization" tab\), you will see the list of users which are all the agents added to your organization. An operator agent is marked with a star icon. \(Note: An organization operator is different from a channel operator.\) The owner of the organization is marked with a key icon.

### Search for organization agents <a id="organisaation-jasenten-haku"></a>

If your organization has a large number of agents, the user list is divided into several pages.

Instead of browsing through all the pages, you can filter or search for a specific agent by typing the name or part of the name in the Filter field.
