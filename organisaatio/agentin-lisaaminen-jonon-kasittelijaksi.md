# How to add agent to queue?

## Add an agent to a queue

Once the agent is added to the organization, go to the Organization settings.

In the "Organization" tab, click the agent row in the member list to see the agent's details and his/her rights in a new view.

![Organization members](../.gitbook/assets/organization-organization%20%281%29.png)

In the new view, you will see the list that shows all of your organization's queues. Check the box \(under "Member"\) of an appropriate queue\(s\) for that agent. Queue agent status can be granted according to knowledge or field e.g. language skills, information, job, location, etc.

You can give organization operator rights to an agent if you want he/she to view statistics and message history of \(all\) queues, and manage other users in the organization, by clicking the button "Give operator status".

You can also remove an agent from the organization and queues by clicking the button "Remove membership". Please note that the user must be removed separately from the team channel and other chat channels.

You can return to the user list by clicking the "Back" button.

Once you have added an agent to a queue, the queue will appear to him/her in the Sidebar under the organization's customer care queues.
