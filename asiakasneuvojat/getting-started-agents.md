# Getting started - Agents

## Starting as new agent

Here are brief instructions how you can get started as a new agent. See more specific instructions from info page behind the links. These instructions are for new agents whose company or community already has an organization in Ninchat.

## Creating an account

### 1. Join Ninchat via invitation link sent to you.

You have received an invitation link via email. Use Chrome and Firefox browsers only.

Open the invitation link by clicking the _Accept invitation_ -button in your email message.

### 3. Permission to show notifications

When you sign in to Ninchat the browser asks to give ninchat.com a permission to show notifications. Allow notifications. Now you will receive notifications of new messages etc.

![Allowing notifications in different web browsers](../.gitbook/assets/new-user-notification-permit%20%281%29.png)

### 4. Verify your account

You still need to verify your account. In your email you will receive a message that contains a link you need to click on to verify your account.

Use the verification link only once.

Add your name to _Lempinimi/Screen name_ and your real full name to _Koko nimi/Real name_.

Save the changes you've made by clicking _Tallenna/Save_.

### 2. Notification settings

In options move to the tab _Ilmoitukset/Notifications_. 

Ninchat can notify about events and messages in three ways: sound, desktop notification and email message. In addition, these notifications can always be seen in the _Tapahtumat/Events_ -section in Ninchat's sidebar.

Whether you have not given permission for browser notifications \(desktop notifications\), you may do so by clicking the _Salli/Enable_ -button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/user_settings_notifications%20%282%29.png)

In the notification settings the most useful notifications has been set as default. You can add or remove specific notifications i.e. email.

Mark the part _Näytä ilmoitukset vaikka olisit paikalla/Show notifications even if present_ and you'll receive the set notifications even when you have Ninchat active on your screen.

More info on page _User settings and profile:_

## Team channel

After the invitation you can see your internal team channel where you can talk in group about the chat and other subjects. In addition, you have possibly been invited to separate technical support channel where Ninchat staff and your own advisors help with chat-related issues. 

![View of team channel: The conversation and the list of members](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vF6Ck5-WasKyMg03jHp1T9-QcfBnb9b4BqueuGcYwzpVG2N5pRN2akPJDBwHDN8QRVAnidbXVJtmtSbTANMrUyEm8d2FL12C8Fwx0x65bQ3NbBAGm8JVprJtYlgrGYxFbrnUz85RhU8)

In the team channel you can ask your main user to add you as customer queues' handler \(or i.e. moderator of public group chat\).

From the team channel's memberlist you can also start 1-1 private conversations with your team mates. Read more on following sites:

{% page-ref page="../team-channels/" %}

{% page-ref page="../general-tips/user-interface.md" %}

## Customer queues and chats

Once you have been added as handler of customer queues, your queues can be seen in the left sidebar where you can pick customers.

If you have received _operator rights in your organization_ you can open and close queues, change settings and view statistics. How rights are given depends entirely on your community.
