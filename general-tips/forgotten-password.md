{% hint style="info" %}
_**Problem:** When I click the "Reset password" link in the mail, the "Change password" -form flashes in the screen but the system logs me in Ninchat and I can't use the form._  
**Solution:** Log out from Ninchat before requesting a password reset link or clicking the reset link.
