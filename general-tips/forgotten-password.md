## Reset password

1. If you are signed in Ninchat, log out first.
2. Go to [https://ninchat.com/app](https://ninchat.com/app).
3. Click the "Forgot your password?" link \(below the "Sign in" button\).
4. Enter your email address.
5. Click the "Send password reset email" button.
6. Open the email with the subject "Ninchat - Password reset confirmation" in your inbox.
7. Click the button "Click to reset your password".
8. The link will open a web page where you can set a new password for your account. Create a new password and then press "Change password".
9. You can now sign in with your email address and the new password.

### Common problems

#### When I click the "Reset password" link in the mail, the "Change password" -form flashes in the screen but the system logs me in Ninchat and I can't use the form.

> Log out from Ninchat before requesting a password reset link or clicking the reset link.

#### "Change password" form says: "Error changing password". 

> You have already used the reset link once. If you still don't know your password, order a new reset link to you email.

#### "Change password" form says: "Just requested".

> You cannot request password reset multiple times in a row. If you e.g. made a typo while setting a new password, wait 15 minutes to request a new reset link, and set your password again.
