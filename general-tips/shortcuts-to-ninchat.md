# Bookmarks & shortcuts

You can make launching and using Ninchat easier with shortcuts and bookmarks. Below is a guide to how you can do it in different browsers.

## Create a bookmark or shortcut directly to a specific channel

You can either create a general shortcut/bookmark to [https://ninchat.com/app](https://ninchat.com/app)  
or   
you can directly launch a specific channel on Ninchat, by creating a bookmark in your browser when you are on the desired channel. The address looks like this: [https://ninchat.com/app/\#/c/1p255nth008](https://ninchat.com/app/#/c/1p255nth008)
