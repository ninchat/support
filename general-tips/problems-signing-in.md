# Problems with sign-in

## Forgot your password?

{% page-ref page="forgotten-password.md" %}

## Something wrong with the user interface? <a id="kayttoliittyma-rikki"></a>

{% page-ref page="interface-problems.md" %}

## Where can I access the service?

If your shortcut to Ninchat disappears or the address is forgotten, you can always access Ninchat by going to [**https://ninchat.com/app**](https://ninchat.com/app) in your web browser. 

## Team channels not visible? <a id="tiimikanavia-ei-nay"></a>

Below you can find some situations when you cannot see the team channels you want.

### Wrong organization selected <a id="vaara-organisaatio-valittuna"></a>

If you do not see familiar channels and customer care queues in your Sidebar, you may have selected another organization or Public site.

Go back to your desired organization by clicking the arrow icon next to the current organization name on the top of the Sidebar. Then select the organization you want from the drop-down menu.

### You signed up for the service without an invitation link <a id="rekisteroidyit-palveluun-ilman-kutsulinkkia"></a>

Do you see the following screen instead of your team channel after signing in?

You have probably come to Ninchat without an invitation link and you are in a situation that you do not belong to any organization or team channel.

Find Ninchat invitation email in your inbox and click the invitation link \(see instructions in the section "How to accept invitation?"\), or ask a colleague or Ninchat staff for a new invitation link to the team channel.

## Invitation link not working?

The invitation link does not work and you get an error message when trying to accept the invitation?

The invitation link to the team channel is likely to be expired. Invitation links are valid only for 14 days. Ask for a new one from a colleague or Ninchat staff.

## Ask for help in chat <a id="pyyda-apua-chatissa"></a>

If none of the above tips worked, you can ask for help from us in our customer service chat.
