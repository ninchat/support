### Store initial replies in statistics

* The possibility to save pre questionnaire replies is added. The answers are stored in Ninchat's statistics.

### Transfer customer

* It is possible for a client to be transferred from the current conversation to another queue, so that another professional can continue the conversation with the client. Once a queue is allowed for transfer, the transfer customer option shows on the right of the conversation section.
