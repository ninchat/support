## Statics view

You can access statistics also from Organization settings, on _Queues_ tab.

In statistics you can view chat histories, tags, user satisfaction, questionnaire responses, and metadata. Statistics run almost in real time, updated within an hour or so. Customer agents are able to add tags for six hours after conversation has ended, and statistics will update during this time period.

Statistics data and chat history can be downloaded and saved as a CSV file manually, or they can be exported automatically to a customer's CRM system \(ask Ninchat staff for more details\).

To exit the queue statistics, click "Queue statistics" in the top of the view and select "Close".

The statistics page consists of:
