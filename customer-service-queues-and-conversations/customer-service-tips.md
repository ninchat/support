# Customer service tips

## General advice

### Do not be silent for long <a id="ala-vaikene-pitkaksi-ajaksi"></a>

Do not leave your customers waiting in silence - if you need to look for an answer, respond something briefly instead of just being quiet for several minutes e.g. "Just a moment, I'll figure it out." In particular, a customer talking on the phone does not want to wait too long.

### Distracting users <a id="hairikoijat"></a>

You can try to reduce distracting users with continuous IP blocking \(ask your Ninchat staff\), however, this may not eliminate the problem.

It is best to ignore distracting users. Do not reply and do not close the conversation, just leave him/her alone. In the end, he/she will probably get tired of not getting any attentions.
