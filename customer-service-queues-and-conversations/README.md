# Customer service queues and audiences

Customer audiences are private 1-on-1 conversations  between an agent and a customer. Agent picks customer from a queue, and audience is held using text, attachments, emojis, and if needed, via video call.

Customer audiences may include answers from pre-audience questionnaire, and metadata about the customer. Strongly encrypted identification data may also be added via secure metadata.

Agents can utilize canned messages and they can and tags and notes to the conversation.

## Queue bar and Queue event log <a id="asiakasjonopalkki-ja-nakyma"></a>

Customer care queues appear in the left Sidebar. Clicking a queue bar  will open the queue view, which can be used to pick incoming customers from the queue and view activity log. The queue activity log shows different events of the queue i.e. when the queue was opened and closed, and who picked customers \(accepted audience\).
