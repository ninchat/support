## General

In the Queue settings, "General" tab, you can edit the following:

* Name of the queue;
* Metadata, such as IP address and location, whether it is automatically added to the beginning of the conversation. For additional metadata information, please contact Ninchat staff.
* Secure metadata, whether it is required to be present \(for more information, see the section "Customer care queues and conversations"\).

Make sure to save any changes.

### Support for attachments and video calls

If you would like to be able to upload attachments or use video calls and screen sharing during customer conversation picked from a queue, please contact Ninchat staff.
