# Opening and closing queue

## Opening and closing a queue

The queue can be opened and closed manually, or automatically by scheduling. An open queue is marked with a green circle in the Sidebar and queue view, while a closed queue is marked with a red circle.

### Queueing time

When there are customers in queue, you can see a timer next to the queue name telling how long \(the first\) queueing customer has been waiting.

If queueing time has prolonged for more than one hour, the âˆž infinity symbol is shown instead of time.

## Opening a queue

Click the arrow icon next to the queue name and select "Open queue" from the menu.   
Customers can now join the queue.

## Closing a queue

Click the arrow icon next to the queue name and select "Close queue" from the menu.   
After that, customers cannot start a chat. Customers in the queue at the time of closing will remain in the queue until they are picked or they decide to close the chat/window.
