# Transferring customer

Once a conversation started, the customer can be transferred to another queue so that another agent can pick up the conversation. For example, the first responding nurse can refer the customer to a doctor's queue if needed.

During transfer, the customer sees queueing view temporarily. When he is picked from the transfer queue, previous conversation is shown for them again.

Transfer queues can be enabled in the queue settings. Once a queue is allowed for transfer, the transfer customer option is displayed on the  top of the chat features.
