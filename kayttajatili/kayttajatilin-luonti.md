# Create an account



{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser for Ninchat.
{% endhint %}

## **Create an account**

Go to [https://ninchat.com/app/](https://ninchat.com//app/), choose the tab "Create account" and enter the following information:

* **Name: Your real name or nickname**
* **Email: Email address of the company/organization you are using e.g. matti.mainio@yritys.com**
* **Password: A strong password for the account**

To continue, click the **"Create account"** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
A strong password is a combination of at least 13 characters which cannot be directly found in dictionary. Always use a different password for each service.

Great! Now you have succesfully created and verified your Ninchat account.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The verification link is for one-time use** - you need to click it only once. After that, you can sign in at [https://ninchat.com/app](https://ninchat.com/app).
{% endhint %}

### Outdated verification link

If you haven't verified your account on time, the verification link goes out of date and doesn't work anymore. In this case you can order a new link in your Ninchat user settings. More info on _User settings and profile_ page.
