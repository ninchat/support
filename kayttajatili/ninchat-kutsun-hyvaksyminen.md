# How to accept invitation?

## Accept an invitation

Get started with an invitation from Ninchat staff to the organization you belong to. 

1. **You will receive an invitation link in your email.** 
2. **Click the "Accept invitation" button to open the link.**
3. **In the pop-up window, choose "Accept invite".**

The link will expire after 14 days. If the invitation link does not work or you have not received the invitation, please request a new link from Ninchat staff or an operator of your Ninchat channel.
