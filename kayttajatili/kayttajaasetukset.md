Note! If you delete all of your sign-in options, you will no longer have access to your account. So please always keep at least one email.

## Notifications

Notifications help you respond faster. In the "Notifications" tab, you can set audio and desktop notifications for different types of activities on Ninchat. You can also receive notifications via email for some types of activities.

Even when the browser window is minimized, desktop notifications can still tell you what happened. A desktop notification will appear in a corner of the window as a popup box which you can click to view the new activity on Ninchat. Read more below.

![Recommended notification options. Remember to allow desktop notifications.](../.gitbook/assets/user_settings_notifications%20%282%29.png)

### Notification settings

**It is recommended to enable Audio and Desktop notifications for at least the following types of activities \(see the image above\):**

* **Private messages**
* **Channel highlights**
* **New person in audience queue**
* **Audience messages**

Save the changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note! Notifications for "New person in audience queue" and "Person picked from queue" are only visible to agents granted with queue agent status.
{% endhint %}

### Always receive notifications

If you want to always receive audio and desktop notifications even when Ninchat is active on your screen, under "Advanced settings", check the box _"Display notifications also when not idle"_ and save. This makes it easier to track any activities.

### Desktop notifications

Desktop notifications require permission from your web browser in order to be displayed to you.

Allow the browser to display desktop notifications by clicking the "Allow" button. Notification permission is browser and device specific, so make sure to allow permissions on all browsers and devices you are using.

#### Windows operating system

Desktop notifications are displayed on the screen one by one. The rest can be found in Action Center \(Windows 10\) until you acknowledge them. [Learn more about Action Center](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026791/windows-how-to-open-action-center).

### Confirm desktop notifications

If you want desktop notifications to remain on screen until you confirm by clicking or closing it, under Advanced settings, check the box _"Close desktop notification only after interacting eg. mouse click"_. By doing this, the notifications will not be missed by you. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Desktop notifications work on Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge browsers.   
Desktop notifications are not supported by Internet Explorer \(IE\).
{% endhint %}

#### Display a desktop notification

## Highlights

In the "Highlights" tab, check the box "Highlight your name" so that you will be notified when someone mentions you in a conversation. You can also set your own highlighting words to get notified whenever they are mentioned.

#### **How to set highlighting words?**

1. Write the words that you want them to be hightlighted, separate each word with a comma \(,\).
2. You can extend the variations of a word that starts with the same letters by adding an asterisk \(\*\) after the word e.g. Fin\*. This means the word Fin is still highlighted even when someone mentions Finland, Finnish, Finn, or Finns.
3. In the "Notifications" tab, you can also enable email notifications for Channel highlights.
4. Save.
