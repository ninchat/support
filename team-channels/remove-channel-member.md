# How to remove a channel member?

## Remove a user from a channel

A user must be removed from each channel separately. The user will not automatically leave any channels although he/she is removed from the organization. Removing a user from a channel requires moderator rights of that channel.

1. Make sure you have the channel moderator rights. If you are a channel operator, you can grant the rights to yourself by clicking your name in the channel member list and selecting _Give moderator right_s.
2. Click the name of the user to be removed and select _Remove from channel_ in the drop-down menu. The user will be removed from the channel.
3. Repeat for other channels as needed.
