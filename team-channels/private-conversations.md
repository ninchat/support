# Private conversations

You can have private 1-on-1 conversations with your teammates alongside the team channels.

## Start a private conversation

### Start a private conversation with a channel member

You can start a private conversation with a teammate from the member list. Click the username and then select "Start private conversation".

A bilateral conversation will open, which is initially empty. You will see the name of the person you are chatting with at the top of the conversation section. The first time you send a message, the user will be notified of a private conversation.

## Conversations

You can communicate in a bilateral conversation just as you would do on a team channel. You cannot moderate private conversations e.g. hide messages.

You can send pictures and files to each other if your user account has the required amount of space quota.

## Leave a private conversation

You can leave a private conversation by clicking the person's name at the top of conversation section or the arrow icon next to the person's name in the conversation list, and selecting "Hide conversation".
